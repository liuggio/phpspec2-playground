===================

Behaviour tested on Travis: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liuggio/phpspec2-playground.png)](https://travis-ci.org/liuggio/phpspec2-playground)

PHPSpec2 by examples. Just a place to play as a kid, with BDD in PHP

The idea behind this repository is to give more visibility to the BDD and in particular PHPSpec2 by examples.

This library presents several design patterns tested with the behavior driven developement,
you will appreciate the differences with the xUnit world.

## Theory

[Spec BDD with phpspec](http://www.phpspec.net/)
